simple-gae-boilerplate
======================

A simplified, frontend focused, Google App Engine boilerplate based on the gae-boilerplate by Coto.

======================

The goal here is to allow for quick rollout of traditionally structured websites. It's lean and simple. Thats it.

What it does have:

- Preconfigured App.yaml, handlers, and routes
- Set up for base handlers (universal/site wide handlers)
- Jinja2 templating
- Best practice App Engine folder structure


What it doesn't have:

- SASS/SCSS/LESS
- Database setup
- L10N support
